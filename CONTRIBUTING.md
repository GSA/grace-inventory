We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a GSA open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

## Submit an issue

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions. This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well as others who are interested in this solution.  

## Requesting a change

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a pull-request.  All new code should have associated unit tests that validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects.  Additionally, the code should follow any stylistic and architectural guidelines prescribed by the project. In the absence of such guidelines, mimic the styles and patterns in the existing code-base.

## Further inquiry

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md) and adhere to its [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
